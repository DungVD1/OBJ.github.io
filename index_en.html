                    <p class="text-gray-600">The OB JP production unit was established to meet the specific demands of the Japanese market, focusing on direct interaction and consultation with clients. Based on our experience working with Japan, the realities of the Japanese market, and fierce competition with other outsourcing companies, we recognized the need for people who could understand, work directly with, and consult with clients in Japan. That's why we have SMR.</p>

                                <li>Key members at the DU as well as former VJP colleagues have told me they have resigned or plan to resign because they are not a good fit with the current organization. Specifically, after the merger of VJP and VGB, there was a culture clash that was not positive for the members, new leadership lacks support for members, and career paths are unclear.</li>

                                <li>Issues recur repeatedly, and quality management does not improve (e.g., NAL).</li>
                                <li>Product quality is unstable and does not comply with procedures (e.g., PES, GUL, Lixil, SMW).</li>
                                <li>In issue-resolution meetings, managers always announce that procedures and personnel are in place, but the problems remain unresolved. OB has received feedback that the issues were not reported to the CDO despite multiple meetings with the CDO, and the response was "all markets are the same."</li>

Recruiting Japanese leaders to drive client farming has not been met, leading to clients canceling jobs because they can't wait for candidates.</li>

                                <li>In 2023-2024, OBJP did not receive investment from Holding or Alten. Most support programs were for VGB and SWB, and even if there were outputs, we did not have access to them.</li>
                                <li>Information from Alten was not fully implemented in JP, a fact I've received feedback on from former managers.</li>
                                <li>After the organizational change, operations became cumbersome and costly. For example, a new department (BOP) was created solely to approve JP costs, even though the person in charge has no prior experience with this market. This has led to delayed payments to personnel and an additional approval layer that frustrates members. Previously, just two members were sufficient.</li>
                                <li>Incentive payments are delayed by 2 months compared to before, causing frustration for leaders and members.</li>
