                        The OBJP Production Unit was established to meet the specific demands of the Japanese market, focusing on direct interaction and consultation with clients. Based on our experience working in Japan, the realities of the Japanese market, and fierce competition with other outsourcing companies, we recognized the need for people who could understand, work directly with, and consult with clients in Japan. That's why we have SMR.

                                The structural change has caused a wave of resignations, particularly among key personnel:

                                <li>Key member Son resigned, and Mr. Viet changed roles.</li>
                                <li>No new key members were hired after resignations. For example, BRSE reported several months ago that a replacement leader has yet to be hired.</li>
                                <li>Key members at DU and former VJP colleagues reported their resignations because they do not fit with the current organization. After the VJP and VGB merger, a culture clash has emerged, which is not beneficial for members. New leadership lacks member support and a clear career path.</li>

                                <li>In 2023-2024, OBJP received no investment from Holding or Alten. Most support programs were for VGB and SWB, and any outputs were inaccessible to us.</li>
                                <li>Information from Alten was not fully disseminated to JP, as reported by former managers.</li>
                                <li>After the organizational change, operations became cumbersome and costly. For example, a new department (BOP) was created solely to approve JP-related expenses. The person in charge had no prior experience with the market, leading to delayed payments and creating a frustrating extra layer of approval. Previously, only two members were sufficient to handle this.</li>

                        A clear market-oriented strategy is required. If outsourcing, there must be a proper recruitment and personnel cost mechanism for the OBJP production unit, a market that accounts for 40% of VMO's current revenue. For example, VDX, with its low revenue and high recruitment, should be a cautionary tale to avoid similar mistakes from previous years.
